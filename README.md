### CheckPull
Quickly review and merge pull requests on [github](https://github.com/). <kbd>1</kbd> (`Conversation`), <kbd>2</kbd> (`Commits`), and <kbd>3</kbd> (`Files changed`) select the different tabs. <kbd>0</kbd> expands diff folds in order. <kbd>esc</kbd> goes to `Conversation` and focuses the `Leave a comment` field. Finally, <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>m</kbd> does a merge commit; <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>s</kbd> does a squash and merge, and <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> does a squash and merge while also discarding the extended commit message.

### YoutubeChanges
On Youtube, turns off annotations and expands the description box.

#### License
Most code in these User Scripts is licensed under The Unlicense (Public Domain, essentially). Single lines of code (will be minified) immediatelly preceded by a commented line starting with `// _licensed` are not public domain, and their respective licenses will be in that same comment.
